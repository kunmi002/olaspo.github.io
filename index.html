              <h6>Lotus Beta Analytics Nigeria (LBAN) has been in the fore front of the industry delighting its customers with world class
            services using cutting edge technology, products and services designed or tailored to give the customer a lasting
            satisfaction has been a strategy. One of these products is Microsoft SharePoint Online which is continuously evolving
            and improving. One of the key improvements is the availability of modern sites, which are modern Office 365
            group-connected team sites or communication sites, combined with improved functionality that can be consumed from a
            beautiful modern user interface. We have helped our customers to fully transform (or "modernize") a classic site into a
            modern Office 365 group-connected site. We have built applications to match and fit our client’s ambition as a corporate
            organization giving room for greater productivity and interaction in line with such organization’s goals and objectives.</h6>
